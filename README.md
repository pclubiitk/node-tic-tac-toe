node-tic-tac-toe
================

Demo game using Node+Socket
The repo contains a very simple implementation of the classic
Tic-Tac-Toe game using Node.js and WebSockets (socket.io)

The repo contains various tags (v0.1, v0.2 ...) which are organised
step-by-step to reflect the various stages of the development process
(and subsequently formed the basis for the talk). You can either clone
the repository and go to the corresponding tag `git checkout <tag-name>`
or click on the `branch:master -> Tags -> <tag-name>` link at the top
of this page and then download the zip accordingly.
